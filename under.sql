They are born out of active WordPress meetup groups that meet regularly and are able to host an annual WordCamp event. This has worked very well in many communities, with over 120 WordCamps being hosted around the world in 2017.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes though, passionate and enthusiastic community members can’t pull together enough people in their community to make a WordCamp happen. To address this, we introduced <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/">the WordCamp Incubator program</a> in 2016.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The goal of the incubator program is <strong>to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event.</strong> In 2016, members of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/">the global community team</a> worked with volunteers in three cities — Denpasar, Harare and Medellín — giving direct, hands-on assistance in making local WordCamps possible. All three of these WordCamp incubators <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/">were a great success</a>, so we&#x27;re bringing the incubator program back for 2018.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Where should the next WordCamp incubators be? If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven’t been able to get a community started, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next few weeks, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the chosen cities by the end of March.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply, </strong><a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application"><strong>fill in the application</strong></a><strong> by March 15, 2018.</strong> You don’t need to have any specific information handy, it’s just a form to let us know you’re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don’t want to be the main organizer, but for this to work well we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.<br /></p>\n\n<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to hearing from you!<br /></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:53:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"HeroPress: How To Build A Company With WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2465";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:120:"https://heropress.com/essays/build-company-wordpress/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=build-company-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16946:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/022118-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: If you keep showing up, you\'d be surprised what happens." />.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n<div class="embed-container"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Full text of the above video</h4>\n<p>Hey, y&#8217;all! Thanks for inviting me to come share my story on HeroPress. I&#8217;m so excited to be able to talk a little bit to the HeroPress community.</p>\n<p>So, and I&#8217;m doing a video blog or vlog because this is what I do; I&#8217;m a YouTube person. I create YouTube videos every single Wednesday for what I call WordPress Wednesday to help you improve your online marketing inside of the WordPress world. So I&#8217;m used to doing videos, and I asked if I could do my HeroPress story in this format; and they said go for it, so I&#8217;m excited to talk to you at least in a face-to-face scenario.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to  share a little bit of my story and tell you how WordPress basically became my avenue for becoming a millionaire in just five short years.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>So in 1998, I created my very first ever HTML website. My dad was actually doing websites at the time, and I needed a website for my band because that&#8217;s what I wanted to be is a rockstar; so I learned how to build a website, kind of, under his training and a little bit of self-taught stuff and had a lot of fun doing it that way in 1998.</p>\n<p>And then in 2005, I started hearing about WordPress; but in 2008, as I was freelancing around, a client asked me to build him a website. And they said, &#8220;hey, Kori, can you, can you build me a website, but we absolutely have to have it on WordPress?&#8221; I was like, sure, no problem; straight to Google, &#8220;how do you build a WordPress website&#8221;, you know. And over the weekend I pretty much taught myself how to build out a WordPress website, and I loved it.</p>\n<p>My mind was absolutely blown when I saw the drag and drop options inside of menus to create dropdowns, and a form builder; I was just blown away. So those of you who have struggled in the HTML CSS world, you know the magic or the majesty, if you will even, of WordPress and those environments and how easy it makes it. So when I saw that, I really just thought, oh my goodness, this is a full-circle moment for me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I really want to use WordPress now from here on forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I reached back out to my dad and said, &#8220;hey, dad, you know, this is a tool that our customers, all of our clients, have been asking us for&#8221;. They&#8217;ve been wanting access to their websites, and we&#8217;ve not been able to give it to them because, in the past, they had to download Dreamweaver, you know, Photoshop and an FTP program; and that was just too much nerd code for them. So we wanted to be able to give them something like this, and WordPress definitely was that solution.</p>\n<p>So he and I worked back and forth for a few years learning, really truly learning, WordPress; and then in 2012, we decided to launch together, my mom, my dad and I, decided to launch WebTegrity in San Antonio, Texas. And it was a very small concept initially; you know, we just me, literally, the three of us, and me and my folks. And then we hired on a subcontractor who is a great graphic designer here in town to try to help us with the creative side of things, and we started to grow our team.</p>\n<h3>Going Big Time</h3>\n<p>So how did we, in five years, build it up in such a way that we were able to sell it for a deal of a million dollars&#8217; worth of shares, which ultimately is a $20 million value deal? How did we do that? I&#8217;m going to give you a little bit of insight on how we were able to accomplish that in such a short time.</p>\n<p>So the very first thing I want you to realize is we did this in a saturated industry in San Antonio, Texas. When I did a search for web developer or web design firms back in 2012, I had over 700 results of different either freelancers or agencies or ad agencies or some solution out there that was either in the general area, or in the nearby area, that provided that service. So how did we, in six years, end up becoming number six in the entire city? We ranked in the top 10; how did we do that?</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the very first things we did, was we niched ourselves; and, thankfully, WordPress was that solution.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2012, there was not an agency directly in San Antonio that was trying to be the go-to place for WordPress; and we purposely started stepping up and saying we are WordPress only, WordPress only, WordPress only. So if you were looking for a different type of CMS solution, we were not the right fit for you. And very, very quickly, we also started teaching it in the city; so we would teach other agencies. We provided on-site training; we provided weekend workshops. All for a price tag, of course; but that was one of our revenue streams. And, again, it set us as the authority in the city for WordPress; so really important that you understand how to niche yourselves and not try to be all things to all people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The second thing we tried to do was really build a culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And you can see, I don&#8217;t work around boring walls. Everything that I do has to have creative juices flowing around me, right. We just want to create a great culture, a great environment. So we had to hire the right people. So that&#8217;s my next tip to you is be very, very careful on who you allow into your culture of your business, who you hire on, and certainly who you bring on as a leader in your culture in your community. So one of the things that we did right away was realize that we can&#8217;t teach passion, so you gotta find people that have a passion to nerd out on stuff like this.</p>\n<p>And you have to find people who have great integrity to just do their best at all times, and you have to find people who love to be creative and love to solve problems for clients, right, who aren&#8217;t just salespeople, right? So if you can find those things, you can teach nerd code all day long; so be sure to just find people with the right hearts to join your community and then train them up the right way, be sure that you just grow and grow and grow your culture in a healthy way, right.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And another thing that we did, so this is another tip, was understand how to really build a revenue stream that was going to be sustainable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>All right, so wrap your heads around this one because this one&#8217;s key. Very early on in our model as we were selling WordPress websites, part of my pitch was, oh, it&#8217;s just five grand and no more after that. It&#8217;s a one-time fee and you&#8217;re done. That&#8217;s a horrible business strategy. We learned very early on, inside of WordPress world, that you have rain or shine, right; so there&#8217;s a lot of clients coming or there are no clients.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re either slammed working from home even in the evening trying to catch up, or you&#8217;re out on the golf course wondering if you&#8217;re going to get a paycheck next week. It&#8217;s really rain or shine. So how do you create a sustainable model in your business, in your small agency, in your startup; how do you do that, so that when those slow seasons come, you can still pay your team members, you can still keep your lights on?</p>\n<p>Well, we were sitting at a WordCamp; and Jason Cohen from WP Engine was keynoting; and one of the things he said right away is, if you don&#8217;t understand how to create a reoccurring revenue stream in your small agency, you will turn your sign to closed in the next year or two. And he was so right; and it was such a light bulb moment for me that I went back straightaway from that weekend WordCamp up in Austin and I started writing out, okay, how can we create a reoccurring revenue stream? What would that look like inside of our industry?</p>\n<p>And, of course, it was support packages. We didn&#8217;t call them maintenance plans. We certainly didn&#8217;t use retainer, which can have a sense of a negative connotation, right, because of lawyers; sorry! But, still, we didn&#8217;t want to use those words because we&#8217;re already almost creating a, uh, I don&#8217;t think I want to sign up for that type of attitude.</p>\n<p>What we did is we called it support, and very easily, clients were signing up saying, oh, goodness, yes, I need that ongoing support. So use that phrasing, create a model structure where it&#8217;s required, at least for the first 12 months out of the gate as they launch that you are charging them something even as small as $99 a month. And don&#8217;t shortchange yourself on that; put together a great package that you give them that type of value.</p>\n<p>If you were to check out WebTegrity.com, you would see our support plans and what they consist of and the pricing. We&#8217;re very transparent with that. That&#8217;s the way our revenue stream almost doubled our sales in one year and allowed us to keep our lights on when June and July roll around and nobody cares about their websites because they&#8217;re on the beach.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All right, reputation was another huge part of it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s one of the reasons why we named ourselves WebTegrity, but reputation, understanding that that every client that signs up, whether they&#8217;re a $5,000 website or a $50,000 website gets the same type of boutique-style, white glove, handholding relationship, right? Every single project that you launch, you want to produce the absolute, absolute best. You&#8217;re not shortchanging them; you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re not wiring something that you hand off to the client and hope to God it doesn&#8217;t break. You really are trying to find the absolute best solution.</p>\n<p>One of the things that also kept us in high standing with our reputation, of course, was offering that training because what we don&#8217;t want to do is keep the veil covered where nobody can see what we&#8217;re doing, right. We really want to be transparent and train our clients the nerd lingo, train the clients what SEO is and what expectations should be. Having that type of open communication really just started to build together a relationship with our clients that they trusted us; and we met their expectation, right. So be sure to hold strongly to your core values for your reputation. Be sure that you&#8217;re asking people to give you great reviews because that&#8217;ll make a difference.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And the last thing I want to talk about is give back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So at one of the WordCamp US&#8217;s that I went to, Matt himself said, listen, if you&#8217;re making a living with WordPress, you really need to try to figure out how to give back 5% of your time, just 5% of your time a week. How can you do that to give back to the community? Can you start a meet-up group, teach a meetup group; can you facilitate a meetup group where maybe you&#8217;re just the organizer and you never have to speak because you&#8217;re not a fan of speaking?</p>\n<p>Can you organize a WordCamp, volunteer at a WordCamp? Can you write a tutorial and tell people how to do things? Can you teach a workshop; can you make a video?</p>\n<p>And, again, I had a light bulb moment. Of course, I can make videos. So my giveback to the WordPress community is my YouTube channel; every single Wednesday, I&#8217;m creating a video and putting it out there for free to the WordPress world of how to improve your online marketing. That&#8217;s made a huge impact not only, thankfully, inside the WordPress community, but also in my own business model.</p>\n<p>I actually go into WordCamps around the US and people are like, hey, aren&#8217;t you that WordPress girl; don&#8217;t you do videos? It&#8217;s a really cool feeling to be able to give back to the community because I&#8217;ve made my living using WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>So ultimately how did I turn five years into a multi-million dollar buyout? Because we have just recently sold; how did we do that? Ultimately, it was understanding that you have to be able to grow something of value. So as soon as you start your business, you should also be thinking about your exit strategy, right, even in how you name your company.</p>\n<p>If I were to name this Ashton Agency, do you think that I could&#8217;ve just walked away and handed the keys to somebody else named Johnson; it wouldn&#8217;t have worked. Think even about your name; will it stand alone? Can that become a brand that you can hand off and sell as a holistic entity?</p>\n<p>You also want to think about that revenue stream, right, and watch those sales margins. Be sure that your margins are healthy. Don&#8217;t hire until it hurts, until it absolutely hurts. Be sure that you&#8217;re structuring your offerings in such a way that you&#8217;re actually recouping your value. What does that mean? Just understand business better; watch Shark Tank, read more tutorials like this, watch more videos.</p>\n<p>Get a hold of the WordPress community, the core leaders, the speakers that travel around to all the WordCamps. Start following them on Twitter and trying to understand what it is that they&#8217;re training and teaching. There&#8217;s a lot of resources out there for you to gain some ideas from, but ultimately it was me stepping out in the San Antonio community because it was a larger firm here in San Antonio who purchased us.</p>\n<p>So we just kept hammering on the fact that we were the go-to place here in San Antonio for WordPress. We kept training; we kept doing free opportunities, going out and speaking at different events; and people kept seeing us. We kept showing up, so you&#8217;d be surprised what happens. If you keep giving back and you keep showing up to places, you keep establishing yourself as the authority, you keep learning and training and growing your own skill set and growing your team, before you know it, it can happen for you.</p>\n<p>I hope this has been helpful. If you have questions about some of this though, if you&#8217;re trying to grow up your startup, or if you&#8217;re trying to learn how to improve your revenue margins, I&#8217;m always open to a quick twitter conversation or send me an email. I&#8217;d love to connect with you.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the opportunity to share this on HeroPress.</p>\n<p>Bye, y&#8217;all; catch me over on YouTube.

You don&#8217;t need to support every version of WordPress, and you don&#8217;t have to support every version of PHP. Feel free to do this for seemingly selfish reasons. Supporting old versions is hard. You have to &#8220;unlearn&#8221; new WordPress and PHP features and use their older equivalents, or even have code branches that do version/feature checks. It increases your development and testing time. It increases your support burden.</p>\n<p>Economics might force your hand here&#8230; a bit. You can&#8217;t very well, even in 2018, require that everyone be running PHP 7.1 and the latest version of WordPress. But consider the following:</p>\n<p>97% of WordPress installs are running PHP 5.3 or higher. This gives you namespaces, late static binding, closures, Nowdoc, <strong>__DIR</strong><strong>__</strong>, and more.</p>\n<p>88% of WordPress installs are running PHP 5.4 or higher. This gives you short array syntax, traits, function-array dereferencing, guaranteed <strong>&lt;?=</strong> echo syntax availability, <strong>$this</strong> access in closures, and more.</p>\n<p>You get even more things with PHP 5.5 and 5.6 (64% of installs are running 5.6 or higher), but a lot of the syntactic goodness came in 5.3 and 5.4, with very few people running versions less than 5.4. So stop typing <strong>array()</strong>, stop writing named function handlers for simple <strong>array_map()</strong> uses, and start using namespaces to organize and simplify your code.</p>\n<p>Okay, so&#8230; how?</p>\n<p>I recommend that your main plugin file just be a simple bootstrapper, where you define your autoloader, do a few checks, and then call a method that initializes your plugin code. I also recommend that this main plugin file be PHP 5.2 compatible. This should be easy to do (just be careful not to use <strong>__DIR__</strong>).</p>\n<p>In this file, you should check the minimum PHP and WordPress versions that you are going to support. And if the minimums are not reached, have the plugin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not initialize (you don&#8217;t want syntax errors).</li>\n<li>Display an admin notice saying which minimum version was not met.</li>\n<li>Deactivate itself (optional).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do not <strong>die()</strong> or <strong>wp_die()</strong>. That&#8217;s &#8220;rude&#8221;, and a bad user experience. Your goal here is for them to update WordPress or ask their host to move them off an ancient version of PHP, so be kind.</p>\n<p>Here is what I use:</p>\n<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/markjaquith/a08623974b37c2cf0207ee2b120b54da">View code on GitHub</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/markjaquith/status/965605448408813569">Reach out on Twitter</a> and let me know what methods you use to manage PHP and WordPress versions in your plugin!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 15:14:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"Post Status: How WebDevStudios is serving different market segments — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=43724";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://poststatus.com/webdevstudios-serving-different-market-segments-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2637:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Here are some quotes from the parts of the article that quote me or talk about <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n    <p>So it’s no coincidence that one of the first companies to operate with a distributed workforce has roots in the open source movement. Automattic, the company behind open source software tools like WordPress, was founded in 2005 and has always allowed its employees to work from anywhere. The company’s 680 employees are based in 63 countries and speak 79 languages. Last year, it closed its San Francisco office, a converted warehouse — because so few employees were using it. It still has a few coworking spaces scattered around the globe.</p>\n    <p>Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO, said that when the company first started, its employees communicated via IRC, an early form of instant messaging. Now it uses a whole host of software that’s tailor-made for remote work, and as the technology evolves, Automattic adopts what they need.</p>\n    <p>Mr. Mullenweg said Automattic only started having regular meetings, for instance, after it started using Zoom, a video conferencing tool that works even on slow internet connections.</p>\n    <p>He’s become a proponent of office-less companies and shares what he’s learned with other founders who are attempting it. Mr. Mullenweg said he believes the distributed approach has led to employees who are even more loyal to the company and that his employees especially appreciate that they don’t need to spend a chunk of their day on a commute.</p>\n    <p>“Our retention is off the charts,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n    <p>“Where it goes wrong is if they don’t have a strong network outside of work—they can become isolated and fall into bad habits,” Mr. Mullenweg said. He said he encourages employees to join groups, play sports and have friends outside of work. That kind of thing wouldn’t be a risk at big tech companies, where employees are encouraged to socialize and spend a lot of time with colleagues.</p>\n    <p>But for those who ask him about the negatives, Mr. Mullenweg offers anecdotal proof of a workaround.</p>\n    <p>For example, he said he has 14 employees in Seattle who wanted to beat the isolation by meeting up for work once a week. So they found a local bar that didn’t open until 5 p.m., pooled together the $250 per month co-working stipends that Automattic provides and convinced the bar’s owner to let them rent out the place every Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They didn&#x27;t need to pool all their co-working allowance to get the bar, I recall it was pretty cheap! Finally:</p>\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">\n    <p>For Automattic, flying 700 employees to places like Whistler, British Columbia or Orlando, Florida, has turned into a seven-figure expense.</p>\n    <p>“I used to joke that we save it on office space and blow it on travel. But the reality is that in-person is really important. That’s a worthwhile investment,” Mr. Mullenweg said.It might take a while, but some people are convinced that a distributed workforce is the way of the future.</p>\n    <p>“Facebook is never going to work like this. Google is never going to work like this. But whatever replaces them will look more like a distributed company than a centralized one,” Mr. Mullenweg said.</p>\n</blockquote>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 18:44:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Kinsey Joins Automattic";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47931";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"https://ma.tt/2018/02/kinsey-joins-automattic/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:229:"<p>Kinsey Wilson is joining Automattic to run WordPress.com. <a href="https://www.poynter.org/news/one-time-npr-and-nyt-digital-chief-new-adventure-wordpress">Poynter covers the news and has a great interview with Kinsey.</a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 18:56:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 305 – 10up, JavaScript for WordPress Conference, and Jetpack 5.8";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=78136&preview=true&preview_id=78136";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:98:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-305-10up-javascript-for-wordpress-conference-and-jetpack-5-8";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1599:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss the news of the week.

In a <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2018/10up-seven-year-anniversary/">blog post celebrating the occasion</a>, Goldman reviews the previous year and highlights some notable events for the company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We welcomed more than 30 new clients to our portfolio in another record sales year,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;We launched new websites along with web and mobile apps for major brands across verticals as diverse as finance, healthcare, academia, high-tech, big media, consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, and fitness… to name a few.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also highlighted the company&#8217;s commitment to open source and giving back to WordPress.

You see it in React.js and Vue.js emerging as popular front end standards, in the rise of Elasticsearch and NoSQL platforms, with two factor authentication and Google single sign on, with the rise of modern Asset Management Systems.</li>\n<li>For publishers, it’s increasingly becoming about distribution to multiple platforms, more so than<em> just</em> building a website. Google AMP, Facebook Articles, Apple News, Alexa, YouTube channels to name a few.</li>\n<li>If you need any more evidence of WordPress dominance, look no further than how highly in demand top-tier engineering talent is. It’s probably &#8211; literally &#8211; around a factor of 1.5x &#8211; 2x what great engineers were earning 3-4 years ago.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With seven years of experience under his belt, Goldman offers the following advice for those who are in their first or second year of running an agency or in a leadership position.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Don’t be quite so hard on yourself &#8211; when you run a business &#8211; when you’re a lease &#8211; there will always be highs and lows &#8211; don’t dwell on the lows.</li>\n<li>Put more emphasis on building systems, routines, and check-ins that offer a better pulse on the collective and individual fulfillment, engagement, and health of the team, rather than relying on transparent upwards communication.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Congrats to 10up on seven years in business.

I know the birthday of more or less five people. I insist on saying that my son was born on May 11. Incorrect, I was born on May 11, he on May 17. But for some reason, my WordPress dates are permanently etched into my brain. I think it’s because meeting the global WordPress community and helping restart the Italian community are very meaningful moments in my adult life. Please join me in a walk down memory lane <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<h3>May 15, 2015</h3>\n<p>I started building websites with WordPress in 2010: my first website was my own blog, whose only purpose was to publish photos of my son so all the grandparents could enjoy seeing him grow. I enjoyed tinkering around with it, and to my surprise someone wrote asking me to build something similar for them. And they wanted to pay me for it!</p>\n<p>For a few years I worked as an administrative manager during the day and as a web designer at night until I decided to make the jump and become a freelancer.</p>\n<p>I never thought about contributing to WordPress because I wasn’t a back end developer and I didn’t think the project needed people that were not code wizards. Heck, I didn’t even know how WordPress was made or how open source worked exactly!</p>\n<blockquote><p>And then I went to a Freelancers conference in Italy and on May 15 I gave my first talk ever.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Up until that moment I taught small classes, but I never talked in front of more than ten people. I was terrified: in the audience there were more than a hundred people. Some of my friends, but also a lot of seasoned professionals that I respected and admired, and here I was talking about how they should and shouldn’t build a website. I was so nervous, when I grabbed the mic I did such a wide gesture with my arms that the bracelet I was wearing flew through the air to the other side of the room.</p>\n<p>After my talk a guy came to compliment my talk, and I realised that he was one of those people that I respected and admired from afar: <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasartoni">Luca Sartoni</a>, an Automattician whose blog I have been following for a while.</p>\n<p>For the three days of the event we kept chatting about websites, WordPress, entrepreneurship, open source until he convinced me to start a WordPress meetup in my hometown of Torino, Italy. He put me in contact with other people that he knew wanted to do something similar and in less than a month from that conversation we started a meetup. The group now has more than one thousand members, and in March we will celebrate thirty events.</p>\n<h3>November 7, 2015</h3>\n<p>Luca didn’t stop his proselytism in Torino <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" /> That same year, WordCamp Europe was held in Seville and at the Polyglots table a revolution was started. A small group of Italians, used to travelling abroad to attend WordCamps, met there and decided that it was time to organise the Italian community.</p>\n<p>The first step was to revive the blog on the Italian WordPress website: it was dormant for seven years and the first thing we did was publish the dates of meetups that were slowly but surely appearing in the whole country. At the beginning of 2015 there were two meetups in Italy, by August there were eight and their number kept growing.</p>\n<p>Now, if you have met Italians, you know we talk a lot. The two Francescos from Apulia, <a href="https://twitter.com/franzvitulli">Franz Vitulli</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fra83">Francesco Di Candia</a>, took the second initiative that was crucial to bringing us together: they opened a Slack workspace for the Italians, modeled after the UK workspace. For the whole summer we chatted every single day: about WordPress, about how to grow and manage the community that was forming in front of our eyes, how to communicate, how to contribute.</p>\n<p>And then chatting wasn’t enough, we wanted to meet in person. We wanted to put a face and a voice to the avatars. With the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/rosso">Sara Rosso</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/miss_jwo">Jenny Wong</a> we carried out a bizarre plan, almost unheard of: a <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/francesca-marano-standalone-contributor-days-help-make-wordpress-with-your-community/">stand alone WordPress Contributor Day</a>. We would meet in Milano for a day to get to know each other and to learn how to Contribute to WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I like to think that November 7 2015 is the day we became a community: we were not an abstract idea anymore, we were people, meeting in person to make WordPress in Italy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>April 10, 2016</h3>\n<p>The next few months went by in a blur of activities: the meetup organisers in Torino applied to host the first WordCamp in Italy in three years and I lead the organising team, I applied to attend the Community Summit in Philadelphia and I got accepted, I attended the first WordCamp US, my first WordCamp, and volunteered at it. I met a lot of people that helped me become more active and more focused: as a new contributor it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the abundance of amazing projects and tasks you can be part of, but it’s important to keep your focus to be more effective.</p>\n<blockquote><p>After meeting people from all over the world and sharing our experiences I realised the story of the Italian community could be inspiring for other communities and it was worth telling it to a wider audience, so I got completely out of my comfort zone and submitted a talk to WordCamp London.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On April 10th 2016 I gave <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2016/05/30/francesca-marano-rebirth-italian-community/">my first talk at a WordCamp</a> and my first talk in English. I think I didn’t sleep for days before and after the event. It was nerve wracking, but I did it without throwing any bracelet in the air this time.</p>\n<a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WCEU2016.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2457 size-large" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WCEU2016-1024x684.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="641" /></a>I gave the same talk at WordCamp Europe in 2016 and realised the story was relatable to many communities. Photographer unknown, sorry <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" />\n<h3>September 17, 2017</h3>\n<p>Over the following year I kept contributing to WordPress, mostly in the Community team. I participated in the Polyglots activities for a while but then I had to pick and focus my attention. The more I interacted with people from all over the world as a hobby, the more I wanted that to become my job. Although my business as a web designer in Italy was doing good, I felt I wanted to be able to reach more people and find a way to be more involved with the community.<br />\nSo I started looking for a job. I was hesitant at first: all the insecurities I had about myself came back to haunt me. The voice in my head was telling me: you are too old, you don’t have enough technical expertise, you have been contributing for a very short time, English is not your native language, you are a single mom from Italy for crying out loud, who would want to employ you?</p>\n<blockquote><p>Well, it turns out that if you actually look for a job instead of just telling yourself that you really would like a job, chances are you might get one.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last September I started a new chapter in my career as the <a href="https://www.siteground.com/blog/francesca-marano/">WordPress Community Manager</a> at SiteGround and I couldn’t be happier.</p>\n<p>The past 33 months have completely changed my life, personally and professionally: along the way I learned a number of lessons that I know will stay with me forever.</p>\n<h3>Step Up</h3>\n<p>If you want to achieve something, start today. Just start. Start a meetup, leave a comment to encourage someone else, volunteer to take notes of a meeting, participate in the discussion, bring your own ideas to the table. Be a fire starter, for yourself and for the people around you.</p>\n<h3>Step Back</h3>\n<p>None of the above is about you: the community is bigger than you, you are here to build a path for the future. Once you started something, don’t become too attached, let it go and let other people step up and shine. Mentor them, if they ask and if you can.</p>\n<h3>If you want to go faster go alone, if you want to go further go together</h3>\n<p>I am not a huge fan of motivational quotes, but this one is very dear to my heart and it’s one I have to remind myself quite often. I am a perfectionist and a quick learner: this is ok when you start your own business (and it’s ok only at the beginning, but this is a topic for another article!), but when you are part of a team, you are part of something bigger. It might move slower, but its impact is immensely more powerful than anything you’ll be able to achieve on your own.</p>\n<h3>Representation matters</h3>\n<p>I dislike speaking in public. When I say this people tend to laugh it off because I am good on stage. It doesn’t mean that I like it.

I used to do that.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t do that anymore.</p>\n<p>Why? <strong>Granularity</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the benefits of using version control like Git is that when things go wrong, you can pinpoint when they went wrong, and identify what code caused the issue.</p>\n<p>Git has a great tool called <strong>bisect</strong> that takes a known good state in the past and a current broken state, and then jumps around between revisions, efficiently, asking you to report whether that revision is <strong>good</strong> or <strong>bad</strong>. Then it tells you what revision broke your site.</p>\n<p>If you lump all your plugin updates into one commit, you won&#8217;t get that granularity. You&#8217;ll likely get the <strong>git bisect</strong> result of &#8220;great&#8230; one of EIGHTEEN PLUGINS I updated was the issue&#8221;. That doesn&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you do it with granularity:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">for plugin in $(wp plugin list --update=available --field=name);\ndo\n    echo "wp plugin update $plugin" &amp;&amp;\n    echo "git add -A wp-content/plugins/$plugin" &amp;&amp;\n    echo "git commit -m \'update $plugin plugin\'";\ndone;</pre>\n<p>This code loops through plugins with updates available, updates each one, and commits it with a message that references the plugin being updated. Great! Now <strong>git bisect</strong> will be able to tell you <strong>which</strong> plugin update broke your site.</p>\n<p>And what if you can only run WP-CLI commands from within a VM, and Git commands from your local machine? For instance, if you&#8217;re using my favorite tool, <a href="https://local.getflywheel.com/">Local by Flywheel</a>, you have to SSH into the site&#8217;s container to issue WP-CLI commands, but from within that container, you might not have Git configured like it is on your host machine.</p>\n<p>So what you can do is break the process into two steps.</p>\n<p>On the VM, run this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">wp plugin list --update=available --field=name &gt; plugins.txt\nwp plugin update-all</pre>\n<p>That grabs a list of plugins with updates and writes them to a file <strong>plugins.txt</strong>, and then updates all the plugins.</p>\n<p>And then on your local machine, run this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">while read plugin;\ndo\n    echo "git add -A wp-content/plugins/$plugin" &amp;&amp;\n    echo "git commit -m \'update $plugin plugin\'";\ndone; &lt; plugins.txt</pre>\n<p>That slurps in that list of updated plugins and does a distinct <strong>git add</strong> and <strong>git commit</strong> for each.</p>\n<p>When that&#8217;s done, remove <b>plugins.txt</b>.</p>\n<p>All your plugins are quickly updated with WP-CLI, but you get nice granular Git commits and messages.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:42:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"Post Status: WordPress market opportunities: Upmarket edition — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=42360";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-market-opportunities-upmarket-edition-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2284:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

They take a look at discovery projects, pitching WordPress against competing platforms, and considerations to make before pitching on these high-budget projects. There are plenty of positives and negatives when working on long-term projects that may have a dramatic impact on your company in many ways.</p>\n<p>In addition to these market opportunities, the boys also discuss recent news including iThemes acquisition by Liquid Web, a welcome change to the WordPress.org plugin directory, and an unfortunate and far-reaching bug that shipped with the 4.9.3 release last week.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/liquid-web-acquired-ithemes/">Liquid Web acquires iThemes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://generatewp.com/new-policy-changes-wordpress-plugin-directory/">Plugin directory notice changes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/02/06/wordpress-4-9-4-release-the-technical-details/">4.9.4 technical details</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wpsessions.com/sessions/infusing-websites-brand-voice/">Infusing Websites with Brand Voice</a><a href="https://wpsessions.com/teams">WPS Team Training</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: WooCommerce</h3>\n<p><a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> makes the most customizable eCommerce software on the planet, and it’s the most popular too.

In <a href="https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-4-introduces-beta-version-of-new-search-module-powered-by-elasticsearch-for-professional-plan-users">October of last year</a>, Jetpack 5.4 began beta testing a new <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/search/">search module</a> based on <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a>. Jetpack 5.8 concludes the beta and the new search service is available to Professional plan customers.</p>\n<p>The new search module replaces the native search functionality in WordPress and Jetpack developers claim sites with a large amount of content, images, or products will see significant speed improvements and more relevant results. Developers can fine-tune the user experience by using custom queries and template tags. Users can sort results by categories, tags, month/year, post type, or any taxonomy.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Content Delivery Network, users have another method to optimize their sites with a new module named Lazy Load Images.

One of my first school memories is of drawing a clown and my art teacher being so enamored with it, she hung it up on her door for the whole year.</p>\n<p>The first time in my educational life I didn’t take an art class was my first year of college. By the end of the year, my fingers were itching and I was ready to scream — I had to take art. It didn’t take long for me to declare a Studio Art minor, which eventually became an Arts and Technology minor my senior year.</p>\n<p>I’ve also always been an internet kid. We received our first internet-connected Windows desktop in 1997. I’ll never forget the sound of dial-up as I signed into AOL, day after day for years to come. When my older brother started working for an ISP, we were able to go beyond just using AOL to connect, and I started spending more time exploring websites (rather than just AOL’s apps and chat rooms). I wanted to be like my older brother and learn how to make sites. I taught myself basic HTML by using View Source on existing sites — even back then, I was benefiting from the open web!</p>\n<p>Angelfire was my earliest web canvas. A couple of my friends eventually got into making websites, but I was always a little disdainful of them for using Homestead’s GUI builder, while I was making my sites from scratch. I had a blast making image-rich personal and fan sites with tables and HTML styles. Landing a copy of Photoshop Elements in high school only intensified my enjoyment of web design. I kept that passion up through college, when I found my first design gig.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/old_web_site.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2442 aligncenter" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/old_web_site-1024x479.jpg" alt="Old Website, best viewed on AOL" width="960" height="449" /></a></p>\n<h3>Could this be a career?</h3>\n<p>My first year of college got off to a bit of a rough financial start. By the time my financial aid was finalized and I was finally able to pick a work study job, my options were pretty limited. A dance professor needed an assistant to help her with some photocopying and organization tasks, along with helping her build out a print and web portfolio.</p>\n<p>I was honestly a terrible assistant, but I did a pretty good job with the design work. I continued to refine my skills working in the computers labs in subsequent years, and in my Junior year of college (ten years ago!) I landed an internship at a local web design agency. That internship turned into a part-time job, which opened up doors to more local web design opportunities, and soon I was graduating college and pretty well situated into the start of my career.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/early-site.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2443" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/early-site-1024x666.jpg" alt="Skeumorphic website design that looks like a notepad with pen ink all over it." width="960" height="624" /></a></p>\n<p>It was at these agencies that I started learning how to build WordPress websites. I’d used WordPress a couple times in college and felt comfortable with it, but now I was focusing a lot more on building my skills as a designer and front-end developer. My girlfriend (who was working at the same web agency) and I managed to convince our boss to start letting us create totally custom websites, rather than customizing existing themes, and that opened up a whole new world of design opportunities.</p>\n<h3>My first WordCamp</h3>\n<p>It was around then that my girlfriend, who attended WordCamp NYC the previous year, noticed the conference organizers were <a href="https://2010.nyc.wordcamp.org/volunteer-designer-needed/">looking for some volunteer designers</a> to help create some graphics. She passed along the information, and I got in touch.</p>\n<p>I collaborated with a few other designers to create the WordCamp branding, which was used across the website, t-shirt, signage, and stickers:</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wcnyc.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2444" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wcnyc.png" alt="WCNYC Banner" width="429" height="286" /></a></p>\n<p>It was amazing to see it everywhere at the WordCamp. It felt really special. Though I didn’t get “props” for this, I still consider it my first contribution to WordPress.</p>\n<p>WordCamp NYC was a ton of fun. I met interesting people, learned a lot about WordPress, and started to get a feel for the community. I left with a desire to get more involved. I browsed through WordPress.org, stumbling upon the “Make” section. I was stoked to see that there was a design group. I couldn’t write much code beyond CSS, but I could contribute my design skills. I joined a couple of the core channels on IRC, including the design channel (#wordpress-ui), and observed for while. I watched how the other designers in the project communicated, what they worked on, where they presented their work, etc. By observing before participating, I could learn the social queues and mores of the community. I didn’t want to embarass myself — I wanted to do things the established way based on community standards.</p>\n<p>What I found to be one of the most difficult parts of contributing was adapting to the technology used to build WordPress. I had to learn how to use command line and SVN. Getting set up in SVN and terminal was probably the biggest thing that stopped me from contributing code during my early years.</p>\n<p>But most of all, it came down to conquering fear. Fear that my design skills would be unwanted and unwelcome; fear that other contributors would look down on me or ignore me, or that they’d find me irritating; fear that I just wasn’t good enough to contribute. Some of this fear persists today, albeit greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>There’s a point at which I managed to conquer a little bit of that fear, stop observing, and really start to pitch in. Slowly, I started chiming in and volunteering for design tasks in IRC and the Make Design p2. I ended up doing a lot of small projects on the community side (rather than the core side) at first — some new landing pages and redesigns of sections on WordPress.org, graphics, and design for my own local meetups. I started feeling more and more confident with my contributions.</p>\n<h3>Core Props</h3>\n<p>By this point, I had done some wireframes and mockups for the core WordPress software — I’d even spoken at a WordCamp! — but I hadn’t actually gotten any code committed. Which meant, at this point in time, I didn’t have any “core props.” I was still really intimidated by Trac and SVN. I was a designer, and most design conversations happened in explicitly design space. But I really wanted to get some code committed into core, so I needed to find a CSS bug I felt qualified to fix.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp Philly in 2012, I finally got a chance. Sunday was devoted to contributing to WordPress. There were experienced core contributors present who could teach people how to make a patch, how to submit a ticket, and suggest tickets for people to work on.</p>\n<p>Aaron Jorbin, a core contributor and fellow speaker (and, now a friend), found a CSS issue I could work on: bringing the alternate “blue” color scheme into sync with the default “grey” scheme. He helped me get set up, helped me through saving my changes as a patch, and then helped me submit that patch to Trac. Andy Nacin, another core contributor (and future friend!) subsequently committed that patch, and I received my first core props.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/first-props2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2445" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/first-props2-1024x370.png" alt="Screenshot of ticket giving Mel props" width="960" height="347" /></a></p>\n<p>After creating my first patch, contributing became easier and easier. My confidence grew, and I spent more time participating in IRC, p2s, and Trac discussions. Then, in January of 2013, major design changes started coming to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>My WordPress apprenticeship</h3>\n<p>It started with icons.</p>\n<p>Ben Dunkle, WordPress’s official icon designer, proposed some shiny new icons for the WordPress dashboard. They were “flat” — one color, not a ton of details. The icons were awesome, but they didn’t really fit stylistically with the rest of the admin. The flat styles clashed with WordPress’ heavy use of gradients.</p>\n<p>So, I helped imagine what the admin could look like totally flat. We tried out a couple ideas, got them committed, and refined in code. The stark styles looked really fresh after years of gradients!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, flattening the admin unearthed a whole lot of other issues. There wasn’t enough time to flesh out the new design before the next version of WordPress launched, so the flat styles got reverted and tabled for another time.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon after, I received an email via my site’s contact form:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Name</strong>: Matt</em><br />\n<em><strong> Comment</strong>: Add me on Skype when you get a chance.</em></p>\n<p>I think my heart stopped when I realized I had been emailed by the co-founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg. Matt invited me to come join a group that would take a broader look at redesigning the admin (codenamed “MP6”). It meant a lot for someone as important as Matt to recognize my skills. I spent a lot of my early years as a designer plagued with self-doubt, and suddenly I had someone pointing at me, going “I believe in you!”</p>\n<p>I leapt at the chance.</p>\n<p>Our group worked together on Skype. We quickly scoped the goal of MP6 to only update CSS and a little bit of JS. I helped Ben make some new vector icons, gave feedback and critiqued design proposals, and made some design proposals of my own. It was an intimate group where we all felt free to safely share and critique each other’s work. The mentorship I received from more experienced WordPress designers was invaluable to my growth. Working with these veterans of WordPress really helped me to grow into my fledgling wings.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/">WordPress 3.8 shipped with the updated admin interface</a>, and I knew it was time to take my design career to a new level.</p>\n<p><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4-8-credits-smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2446" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4-8-credits-smaller-1024x895.jpg" alt="WordPress 4.8 Credits" width="960" height="839" /></a></p>\n<h3>Leaving the nest</h3>\n<p>I’d had my eye on Automattic, the makers of WordPress.com, the Jetpack plugin, and many other products, for most of my time contributing to WordPress. A couple of the designers I worked with on MP6 were Automattic designers, and it was an absolute joy to collaborate with them. At this point I’d spent so much of my career as either a lone designer, or in a competitive environment, that having a supportive, collaborative group of people helping me improve my work was a revelation.</p>\n<p>I desperately wanted to work at Automattic.</p>\n<p>While MP6 was in the works, I participated in a three month long design apprenticeship at a local agency. I worked alongside experienced mentors and fellow apprentices to hone my interface and user experience design skills. It was challenging and thrilling and totally complemented the mentorship I was receiving from WordPress folks. Plus, working in a positive environment reinforced my desire to work somewhere similar.</p>\n<p>After the apprenticeship, I finally felt like I had the skills and confidence to apply. I spent a lot of time writing my cover letter, and redesigning my portfolio to use in-depth case studies on a small number of recent projects. I finally sent off my application and crossed my fingers.</p>\n<p>A couple weeks later, I received a reply back asking to schedule an interview. I was terrified, but luckily, Automattic conducts interviews via text, so I was able to hide my fear behind my keyboard and hopefully try to project confidence. (Aside: I also show all my emotions on my face, so online communication is the best.)</p>\n<p>It must have worked, because I was moved on to the next phase of the application, doing a self-contained trial project, which was a whole ton of fun. I was able to put my recently refined research, interviewing, and user testing skills to use. I loved being given a real challenge to tackle. My trial went well, so I was moved along to the final interview with Matt Mullenweg. We spent a couple hours chatting on Skype, and at the end of our conversation I was given an offer. Welcome to Automattic!</p>\n<p>After working so hard on my apprenticeship, and on MP6, joining Automattic felt incredibly validating. The work I put in, the mentorship I received, all of the collaboration, led to this moment. I felt like I had graduated from apprentice and was now embarking on my adventure as a design journeyman. And boy, has it been an adventure!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/automattic-2-smaller.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2447" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/automattic-2-smaller-1024x678.jpg" alt="Automattic Group Photo" width="960" height="636" /></a></h3>\n<h3>Design leadership</h3>\n<p>The past four and a half years at Automattic have been fantastic. I have the best coworkers anyone can ask for. I’ve worked with some incredibly talented and empathetic designers, whose guidance and feedback constantly encourage me to improve my skills.</p>\n<p>I’ve continued to contribute to WordPress, slowly gaining more responsibility in the project the longer I stuck around. That’s the secret to becoming an open source leader, I discovered — <strong>decisions are made by the people who show up</strong>.</p>\n<p>In 2016, I was asked to by the Release Design Lead for <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/04/coleman/">WordPress 4.5 “Coleman.”</a> I worked alongside the other release leads to make design-related decisions that impacted the release. This was the first release we experimented with having a Design Lead. I felt like design finally had a seat at the table.</p>\n<p>This continued to be the case last year, when Matt Mullenweg announced core focuses for the year: Editing, Customization, and the API. Both Editing and Customization had designers co-leading their focus. I was named the Customization co-lead. I’d been working on customization and site building on WordPress.com for over a year, so I had relevant experience.</p>\n<p>I worked with my developer co-lead, Weston Ruter, on low-hanging fruit, most of which we released in WordPress 4.8. The release was smaller, focused more on improvements than new features. We made a lot of updates to widgets, which had been long neglected.</p>\n<p>After that, we turned our sights to some more ambitious projects: drafting and scheduling changes in the Customizer, improvements to code editing in the WordPress admin, even more widget updates, and upgrades around the flow of changing themes and building menus for your site. We took a design-first approach to building out these new features, and I think it really shows in the work that we produced during the 4.9 release cycle, which Weston and I co-led.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/11/tipton/">WordPress 4.9 “Tipton”</a> launched in November. Since then, I’ve pivoted to work on <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>, the new editing experience for WordPress which should be released in 5.0. Once the editing experience wraps up, we’re going to start looking at how we can extend Gutenberg to cover site building and customization.

Alternatively, you can update by uploading the files via SFTP or by using WP-CLI.</p>\n<p>Dion Hulse, WordPress lead developer, says managed hosts that apply updates automatically for their customers will be able to update sites as they normally do. This may explain why some users have reported that sites running 4.9.3 have automatically updated to 4.9.4 without issue.</p>\n<p>The bug stems from an attempt to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43103">reduce the number of API calls</a> made when the auto update cron job is run. Unfortunately, the code committed had unintended consequences. &#8220;It triggers a fatal error as not all of the dependencies of <code>find_core_auto_update()</code> are met,&#8221; Hulse said.</p>\n<p>A postmortem will be published once the team determines how to prevent this mistake from happening in the future. &#8220;We don’t like bugs in WordPress any more than you do, and we’ll be taking steps to both increase automated coverage of our updates and improve tools to aid in the detection of similar bugs before they become an issue in the future,&#8221; Hulse said.</p>\n<p>While WordPress 4.9.3 and 4.9.4 do not include any security fixes, it&#8217;s important to note that in order to receive automatic security updates in the future, sites using the 4.9 branch must be running at least 4.9.4.

You can also use tools like <a href="https://local.getflywheel.com/">Local by Flywheel</a>, or <a href="https://www.mamp.info/">MAMP Pro</a> to run a local &#8220;dev&#8221; version of your site. These are great ways of testing code changes, playing with new plugins, or making theme tweaks, without risking breaking your live &#8220;production&#8221; site.</p>\n<p>Here is my advice for working with different WordPress environments.</p>\n<h2>Handling Credentials</h2>\n<p>The live (&#8220;production&#8221;) version of your site should be opt-in. That is, your site&#8217;s Git repo should <strong>not</strong> store production credentials in <strong>wp-config.php</strong>. You don&#8217;t want something to happen like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag/accidentally_destroyed_production_database_on/">when this developer accidentally connected to the production database</a> and destroyed all the company data on his first day.</p>\n<p>Instead of keeping database credentials in <strong>wp-config.php</strong>, have <strong>wp-config.php</strong> look for a <strong>local-config.php</strong> file. Replace the section that defines the database credentials with something like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">if ( file_exists( __DIR__ . \'/local-config.php\' ) ) {\n    include( __DIR__ . \'/local-config.php\' );\n} else {\n    die( \'local-config.php not found\' );\n}</pre>\n<p>Make sure you add <strong>local-config.php</strong> to your <strong>.gitignore</strong> so that no one commits their local version to the repo.</p>\n<p>On production, you&#8217;ll create a <strong>local-config.php</strong> with production credentials. On staging or development environments, you&#8217;ll create a <strong>local-config.php</strong> with the credentials for those environments.</p>\n<h2>Production is a Choice</h2>\n<p>Right after the section that calls out <strong>local-config.php</strong>, put something like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">if ( ! defined( \'WP_ENVIRONMENT\' ) ) {\n    define( \'WP_ENVIRONMENT\', \'development\' );\n}</pre>\n<p>The idea here is that there will always be a <strong>WP_ENVIRONMENT</strong> constant available to you that tells you what kind of environment your site is being run in. In production, you will put this in <strong>local-config.php</strong> along with the database credentials:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">define( \'WP_ENVIRONMENT\', \'production\' );</pre>\n<p>Now, in your theme, or your custom plugins, or other code, you can do things like this:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">if ( \'production\' === WP_ENVIRONMENT ) {\n    add_filter( \'option_gravityformsaddon_gravityformsstripe_settings\', function( $stripe_settings ) {\n        $stripe_settings[\'api_mode\'] = \'live\';\n        return $stripe_settings;\n    });\n} else {\n    add_filter( \'option_gravityformsaddon_gravityformsstripe_settings\', function( $stripe_settings ) {\n        $stripe_settings[\'api_mode\'] = \'test\';\n        return $stripe_settings;\n    });\n}</pre>\n<p>This bit of code is for the Easy Digital Downloads Stripe gateway plugin. It makes sure that on the production environment, the payment gateway is always in <strong>live</strong> mode, and the anywhere else, it is always in <strong>test</strong> mode. This protects against two very bad situations: connecting to live services from a test environment (which could result in customers being charged for test transactions) and connecting to test services from a live environment (which could prevent customers from purchasing products on your site).</p>\n<p>You can also use this pattern to do things like hide Google Analytics on your test sites, or make sure debug plugins are only active on development sites (more on that, in a future post!)</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t rely on complicated procedures (&#8220;step 34: make sure you go into the Stripe settings and switch the site to test mode on your local test site&#8221;) — make these things explicit in code. Make it impossible to screw it up, and working on your sites will become faster and less stressful.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 05 Feb 2018 14:59:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"Matt: National Magazine Award Nomination";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47900";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"https://ma.tt/2018/02/national-magazine-award-nomination/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:761:"<p>Longreads <a href="http://www.magazine.org/asme/about-asme/pressroom/asme-press-releases/ellies-2018-finalists-announced">was nominated today</a> for its first-ever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Magazine_Awards">National Magazine Award</a>, in the category of columns and commentary, alongside ESPN The Magazine, BuzzFeed News, Pitchfork, and New York magazine.

Cory Miller &#8212; CEO of iThemes &#8212; will be the Business Manager of the new unit, with iThemes COO Matt Danner as the Director of Technology and Operations for iThemes. The entire team of twenty three people is staying on, and will continue to be headquartered in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>This is not the first or last time we&#8217;ll see longstanding WordPress companies get rolled into large hosting providers. It&#8217;s a trend that is natural in any ecosystem as it matures, and iThemes was a clear and quality candidate for a host to target. Cory said the culture around Liquid Web, including their &#8220;heroic support,&#8221; but also the quality he sees in their management team, was a key motivator for them to go work with Liquid Web.</p>\n<p>As hosting companies evolve more and more to provide broader services for customers with managed WordPress offerings, there is less room for utility product creators to fill that gap.</p>\n<p>Backups are a fine example: customers may see less need for external backups if they have confidence that their hosting is managing backups properly. Security is another. These have been great products for iThemes, and still are &#8212; but their current markets are more for hosts without a managed experience, and that slice of the pie has been narrowing.</p>\n<p>iThemes has had a partnership with Liquid Web for about a year and a half now, which started by licensing iThemes Sync for Liquid Web&#8217;s WordPress hosting offering. They&#8217;ve slowly been integrating more features into the platform, and the acquisition will allow Liquid Web to further integrate iThemes&#8217; offerings, and allow iThemes to improve some of their product offerings with the backing of Liquid&#8217;s Web&#8217;s hosting infrastructure.</p>\n<p>I spoke to Cory Miller about the move, which is occurring not long after iThemes&#8217; ten year anniversary in business. He said he looks back every year and sees them as chapters in the iThemes story, and this feels just the same. He&#8217;s excited about what the backing from Liquid Web will allow them to do, and most importantly for him, the ability to keep supporting the team they have built over the years.</p>\n<p>Cory tells me he&#8217;s amazed that they&#8217;ve been able to build the company they have built, and neither he nor his business partners would have imagined it ten years ago. All equity holders had their shares purchased by Liquid Web, and Cory and the team will be Liquid Web employees.</p>\n<p>iThemes has iterated on the business many times over the years &#8212; as the name implies. Their theme business slowly dwindled in terms of the overall ratio of sales revenue it provided. BackupBuddy has long been a flagship, and they&#8217;ve found great success the past couple of years since they acquired and iterated on the iThemes Security product. He said that it took them experimenting a great deal &#8212; and like Exchange for eCommerce, and others &#8212; it didn&#8217;t always work out the way they hoped. But because they stayed agile and kept working at it, they&#8217;ve consistently been able to grow and diversify their product line.</p>\n<p>One practical component Liquid Web will be able to provide, as an example, is their data centers to power BackupBuddy and iThemes Stash storage and processing. iThemes has historically used Amazon, which Cory said really adds up and has started to eat into their own margins. Liquid Web will help them not only improve the offering but also to be able to perform those functions more affordably.</p>\n<p>For Liquid Web, this acquisition furthers their goal to integrate WordPress-specific functionality into their suite of WordPress hosting tools. They recently launched WooCommerce hosting on their platform, and the iThemes Sales Accelerator product can now be a core component of that offering. Additionally, the technology iThemes has built with BackupBuddy and Sync will further add to their platform.</p>\n<p>Beyond the technology and products, Liquid Web Vice President of Products and Innovation Chris Lema tells me it&#8217;s about the team:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This adds so much to what we’re doing with managed WordPress and managed WooCommerce, that it just made a lot of sense — both from a product perspective, and even more from a team perspective.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Having spent a lot of time with the management teams for each of these companies, I would agree that the culture fit is a really good one. And for Liquid Web, a company continuing to make its big push into the WordPress market, it is a solid strategic acquisition move that offers product dividends but more importantly adds a great and experienced WordPress team to their company.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ithemes.com/2018/01/31/ithemes-joining-the-liquid-web-family/">Cory shares more</a> about the news on the iThemes blog.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:12:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"HeroPress: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2431";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:158:"https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9293:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/013118-2-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: My place in the world has transformed." /><p>When I look back on the past five years I’ve been working with WordPress, I feel the real weight of the journey I’ve had to get where I am. Much of it has been filled with challenge of both of the difficult and welcome variety. I’m an optimist and problem-solver to the core, but I sometimes wonder how I got through these past years. One thing is for certain, my involvement with WordPress, the opportunities and community around it, has been a force for so much good, motivation, and satisfaction in my life.</p>\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\n<p>When I was introduced to WordPress, I was going through one of the most trying times of my adult life. My dad had suddenly passed away just a few years before. We didn’t have the best relationship, but his quirkiness, interest in esoteric things, and passion for food certainly rubbed off on me.</p>\n<p>I was living with roommates, but moved back home to be with my mom. Not too long after, she developed debilitating osteoarthritis in both of her hips. From a physically healthy yet grieving 52-year-old woman to eventually becoming handicap and walker-bound, needless to say, impacted our lives greatly. I became her caretaker, and I also worked retail part-time for the flexible schedule.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt emotionally exhausted, uninspired and quite lost with what my next steps would be.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I grew up using the internet fervently as a youth and in my college years. I met new friends, learned new skills, and traveled to new places thanks the endless source of information it provided for my active mind. So when a friend, now my mentor, John Bolyard, approached me to help him in his web marketing and development consultancy using “WordPress” I just said “yes.” It was mysterious, being unknown to me, and intriguing, which is usually a green light in my book!</p>\n<p>I started doing administrative work on a website he helped develop for a national guild. Like many situations, he had finished their website and they would circle back to him for minor updates. I took on the minor updates, started tinkering on my own, and fell in love in the process.</p>\n<p>The accessibility with which one could make changes and produce content dynamically was just mind blowing to me. It was my gateway to web development and now I could make web content with the ability to work with code, if I so chose. It seemed an endless source of learning and knowledge- it was a great fit.</p>\n<h2>Levelling Up</h2>\n<p>That went well and he brought me on a larger project to help the artist, Dorothy Braudy, create her website archive. I was able to blend my affinity for the technical and handy visual memory to help an all around amazing person (she&#8217;s still one of closest people in my life) tell her story through her art. I was thrilled to have the challenge and the privilege to bring her vibrant and prolific work (hundreds of pieces) to the web.</p>\n<p>I also started assisting John with teaching WordPress classes at SCORE, a government organization that helps people develop and sustain small businesses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We volunteered our time teaching business owners WordPress to help them build their own websites.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was challenging yet rewarding to see them feel empowered that they could take a hands-on role in making their web presence.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I ended up with several clients and that’s how my freelancing career began :). I also started going to meetups. John brought me to my first one in the San Fernando Valley. I was like wait&#8230;this software is cool and people gather to talk about it? I can also learn stuff too?! Get outta town!</p>\n<p>Well, I started attending fairly frequently. Particularly, the meetup in the West Valley lead by Andrew Behla (then at the Topanga Canyon Library). I soaked up info from presentations given by Roy Sivan, Suzette Franck, and Lucy Beer (who is now my teammate). Just to name a few ;).</p>\n<p>After building a consistent client base, I also started working part-time as a project assistant at a boutique museum exhibit development firm. My first project was for the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens supporting the development of an educational WordPress website for their Junípero Serra exhibition. What were the chances? My skills in WordPress proved helpful for the project and the firm&#8217;s website.</p>\n<h2>Pivoting</h2>\n<p>At this point, I had seen my mom through her first hip replacement and recovery, and she was moving on to her next one. I thought about where I saw myself and also where I could build a sustainable future given the circumstances. I thought WordPress, and so I did a trial as a Happiness Engineer at WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>While I didn&#8217;t get the position, I met some great people and learned exponentially more in that short time than I had on my own. More so, I learned about the users, WordPress’ strengths and weaknesses, and how to fill that gap in an accessible way. I was sad, but also motivated. I took on more client work and just did the thing.</p>\n<p>After three years, it was time to leave the exhibit development firm. It was fascinating, it provided me a design, development and project management vocabulary I had never encountered before. However, I needed a firmer career path and I still thought WordPress. My mom was recovered, I had also just recovered from some health issues, and I knew it was time for a change.</p>\n<p>While doing client work for several months, I also explored options on how I could &#8220;level up.&#8221; Maybe it was my time to dig into web development: should I learn on my own, go to a school?</p>\n<blockquote><p>In my gut, I knew I had to find work that supported my endeavors, so I started applying in the WordPress and tech ecosystem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I networked, attended workshops, and met some awesome folks in the local tech and WordPress communities. I was also approached about joining the organizer team for WordCamp Los Angeles (WCLAX). I said “yes” (that magic word) and last year we had a great event.</p>\n<p>When we started planning, I had also heard from WP Media, (the company behind the WP Rocket and Imagify plugins), that I was hired for their Customer Support position. We’re a remote crew spread across 8 countries. However, I’ve been lucky enough to spend time with them at WordCamp Europe, WordCamp US, and our annual retreat last year.</p>\n<h2>Transformation</h2>\n<p>My place in the world has transformed. I&#8217;ve traveled to places once out of reach, work every day with some of the most brilliant and kind people in the WordPress space, and grow day by day with new challenges and opportunities. I&#8217;m happy, mom is healthy, and the journey continues…</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Journey%3A%20Curiosity%2C%20Challenge%2C%20Transformation&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-curiosity-challenge-transformation%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-curiosity-challenge-transformation%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fjourney-curiosity-challenge-transformation%2F&title=The+Journey%3A+Curiosity%2C+Challenge%2C+Transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/013118-2-150x150.jpg&description=The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/" title="The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/journey-curiosity-challenge-transformation/">The Journey: Curiosity, Challenge, Transformation</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 11:00:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Renee Johnson";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WPTavern: WooCommerce 3.3 Increases Theme Compatibility, Auto Regenerates Thumbnails";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=77795";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-3-increases-theme-compatibility-auto-regenerates-thumbnails";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3108:"<p>WooCommerce 3.3 <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2018/01/whats-new-woocommerce-3-3/">is available</a> and is considered a minor release. Based on the project’s <a href="https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/Roadmap-and-release-process">new release process</a>, it should be fully backwards compatible with previous releases up to 3.0.</p>\n<p>The orders screen has been redesigned with large buttons that indicate an order’s status.

In 3.3, improvements have been made so that WooCommerce renders on themes that don’t fully support it, making it compatible with nearly every WordPress theme.</p>\n<p>Users can now set the number of columns and rows for shops with the ability to preview the results live via the Customizer. The columns will resize to fill the entire width of the area and is available on all themes.</p>\n<p>In earlier versions of WooCommerce, shop owners needed to use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/">Regenerate Thumbnails</a> after updating a product’s image as WordPress did not automatically resize the image and generate new thumbnails. WooCommerce 3.3 adds on-the-fly thumbnail regeneration and background thumbnail resizing.</p>\n<p>In addition, users can customize the aspect ratios of product images. The choices are classic square images, custom cropped images, or uncropped images</p>\n<img class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/WC33ImageAspectRatio.png?w=627&ssl=1" alt="" width="627" height="402" />WooCommerce 3.3 Image Aspect Ratio Options\n<p>Shop owners can now view logs of product downloads with a couple of built-in filters including, by order, by product, by customer, and by file. You can also search for extensions now from the Extensions administration screen.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.3 includes more features and changes than what’s listed here.

There are a few ways to do this, but the simplest way is to just make your site root a Git checkout of your site files.</p>\n<p>Then, if your server has read-access to your Git remote, you can run some Git commands to sync everything. Here are your options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>git pull</strong> — Simple, but might fail if someone naughty has made code modifications on the server.</li>\n<li><strong>git fetch &amp;&amp; git reset &#8211;hard origin/master</strong> — The hard reset method will wipe any local modifications that someone has mistakenly made.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But wait. Before you implement this, it is very important that you ensure that your server&#8217;s <strong>.git</strong> directory is not readable, as it might be able to leak sensitive information about your site&#8217;s code. How you do this will depend on what web server you&#8217;re running. In Nginx, I do the following:</p>\n<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">location ~ /\\.(ht[a-z]+|git|svn) {\ndeny all;\n}</pre>\n<p>In Apache, you could put the following in your <strong>.htaccess</strong> file:</p>\n<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">RedirectMatch 404 /\\.git</pre>\n<p>SSHing into your server every time is tedious, so let&#8217;s script that:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">#!/bin/bash\nssh example.com \'cd /srv/www/example.com &amp;&amp; git pull\'</pre>\n<p>Save that to <strong>deploy.sh</strong> in your Git repo, run <strong>chmod +x deploy.sh</strong>, and commit it to the repo. Now when you&#8217;re ready to deploy the site, just type <strong>./deploy.sh</strong> and the public site will pull down the latest changes from your main Git remote.</p>\n<p>Bonus points if you make <strong>deploy.sh</strong> take an optional commit hash, so you can also use this tool to roll back to a previous hash, in case a commit goes wrong.</p>\n<p>This method has served me well, for years, and has required no maintenance.</p>\n<p>What methods are you using for WordPress code deploys?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Do you need <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">WordPress services?</a></b></p>\n<p>Mark runs <a href="https://coveredwebservices.com/">Covered Web Services</a> which specializes in custom WordPress solutions with focuses on security, speed optimization, plugin development and customization, and complex migrations.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to start a conversation!</p>\n[contact-form]";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:31:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WPTavern: UpdraftPlus Acquires Easy Updates Manager Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=77700";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://wptavern.com/updraftplus-acquires-easy-updates-manager-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2048:"<p><a href="https://updraftplus.com/">UpdraftPlus</a>, a popular WordPress backup plugin actively installed on more than 1 million sites has acquired the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/">Easy Updates Manager</a> plugin for an undisclosed amount.</p>\n<p>Easy Updates Manager disables core, theme, and plugin updates in WordPress and provides granular control over them.

The focus for this discussion focused entirely on the entry-level segment of site assemblers and their small-business clients as well as the mid-level market of contractors and agencies selling additional levels of service. The duo talked through a few different strategies employed in each segment, including service differentiation, regional focus, building a network of complementary contractors, systemizing processes, delivering quality customer support flow, and selling ongoing service.</p>\n<p>In addition to this look at market segmentation, the Brians shared a few useful resources for both Gutenberg and WP-CLI.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mike McAlister&#8217;s <a href="http://gutenberg.news/">Gutenberg News</a></li>\n<li>Ahmed Awais&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block">create-gutenberg-block</a></li>\n<li>Delicious Brain&#8217;s <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wordpress-cli-packages-review/">WP-CLI packages reviews</a></li>\n<li>WordPress Website: <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-website-cost/">How much should it cost?</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wpsessions.com/sessions/selling-ongoing-service/">Selling Ongoing Services with Sara Dunn</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sponsor: iThemes</h3>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by <a href="https://ithemes.com/?utm_source=post_status&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=ps_ads">iThemes</a>.

I’m having one of those moments right now as I sit here to share my story with you. It’s bizarre to think of how far I’ve come because I truly thought that I was not good enough to be where I am today. Let’s get into it.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>As a child, I was always around technology. My dad was a computer scientist and considered it a great idea to get each of his four children their own computer so they would stay away from his. So as the years went by with system administrative tasks being “one of the hard-knocks of life”, I went off to Drexel University in 2005 to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I remember when I walked into my first class and instantly saw how different I was. Everyone was white. Everyone was male. And I was not. In fact, I couldn’t even check off one of those boxes. I was opposite. I was female and I was black.</p>\n<p>The first year pursuing my degree actually went really well and finished off the year, completing my C++ final project to create a matching cards game using objects and classes. All was swell. I found that I was doing just as well as everyone else. And I found that was struggling in certain areas just like everyone else.</p>\n<h3>Leaning In</h3>\n<p>Next semester came and that’s when the more difficult course load began. There was one class in particular called “Data Algorithms &amp; Theories” that was incredibly and frustratingly difficult. As someone who always wanted to do well and is inclined to beat herself up for not being “perfect”, it was an incredibly stressful time for me. But once again, I was not the only one who was struggling because the class was difficult for all of my classmates. But as the class progressed, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and ask for help. This was the first time I would actually utilize the teaching assistant (TA) that was often present during this class. So our scheduled meeting comes around and it doesn’t go as I’d hoped. It wasn’t at all a welcoming atmosphere.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The demeanor of the TA made it clear that he didn’t want to be there but my happy-go-lucky personality brushed it aside.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To make things worse, I wasn’t understanding the “simple” concepts that he was explaining and was subject to the TA’s dismissive glances of judgement and shame. I remember at one point, my mind shifted into trying to make him like me rather than realize that he was discriminating against me. Then he said to me “You know, maybe this just isn’t for you. I’ve explained this to you multiple times and you’re just not getting.” This was a very upsetting moment in my life because someone who was supposed to be helping me learn was telling me that you’re too stupid to learn. Needless to say, I left that session very upset and I ultimately ended up changing my major to something “easier” because apparently it “wasn’t for me”.</p>\n<h3>Accepting A Career</h3>\n<p>After I graduated in 2010 with my degree in Information Technology, I moved to DC to pursue an unfulfilling Systems Engineering career in government contracting. Don’t get me wrong. I learned a plethora of valuable skills that I will use for the rest of my life. But I wasn’t doing something that was enriching me. Not only that, I was often made to feel ostracized in the work culture because of the lack of diversity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m not sure if anyone’s told you&#8230;but it’s extremely hard being a minority and working with people who don’t look like you and who can’t relate to you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If someone said something racially insensitive or offensive (and there have been multiple instances), that was always a battle I had to fight on my own. And to be honest, sometimes I didn’t fight because I knew no one would give a damn and the person would get away with it with a slap on the wrist.</p>\n<h3>Remembering Joy</h3>\n<p>So in the mist of all of this, no matter how upset, beaten-up and angry I felt after a work day, I could always come back to my love for the metal music genre. I would spend so much time listening to new metal music after work that co-workers nicknamed me “the DJ”. Which isn’t completely untrue. In college, one of my extracurriculars was to host a weekly metal radio show on the college radio station. But I didn’t have that anymore so I essentially felt a bit lost.</p>\n<p>That’s when I decided to get it back! Not in the form of an actual radio show. But in the form of a metal music blog. Outside of having played around with making marque-filled pages on GeoCities and changing the backgrounds of my MySpace and Xanga profiles to be neon-colored or highly pixelated images, I didn’t have any experience making a website. So I GOOGLED it! And in that research I learned how hosting providers work and the best blogging platform for me to use for my blog. And that platform was WordPress. So in 2015, I launched my first website ever on WordPress: metalandcoffee.com. And this point I didn’t really know anything super WordPress-nerdy outside of being able to select a theme and add/organize content on the navigation bar. But I finally had my own voice live and anyone can see it!</p>\n<h3>Looking Deep</h3>\n<p>Now &#8211; the year was 2017 and words cannot describe how miserable I am in my current work position. I thought transferring to a position within the company that brought me back to Philadelphia would help my pain and suffering but it only numbed it for a couple months. I still didn’t like the environment, I didn’t like what I was doing, and although I was able to look at the occasional code snippet that would give me a spark of confidence when I understood what the code was doing, I wasn’t given an opportunity to be on the other side. This is what lit a fire under me to finally do everything in my power to move towards a developer career. I felt like that was where I was supposed to be. Sure, I was told that I wasn’t smart enough to be anywhere near code but why did it excite me to see it and recognize it? Why was I able to troubleshoot errors even though I wasn’t a developer? Why was I excelling at quality assuring software by being able to understand the code’s logic thus thinking of scenarios that were unaccounted for?</p>\n<h3>Breaking Through</h3>\n<p>So I signed up for a couple online courses focused on web development and eventually found myself having been accepted to <a href="http://www.interactivemechanics.com/fellowship">a front-end developer fellowship program</a> that provided me with an amazing mentor and a final project to work towards. For my final project, I chose to learn how to create a custom WordPress theme for my Metal &amp; Coffee website because the current one that I was using did not fully suite my needs.</p>\n<blockquote><p>And there you have it &#8211; throughout the next 9 months, the doubt and shame instilled in me since college kept coming up and I kept having to find ways to break through it whether it’d be a pep talk from my mentor, talking to developers who look like me (black women) or using meditation to help me through the anxiety.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And by the end of that, not only did I finish my final project (<a href="http://metalandcoffee.github.io">http://metalandcoffee.github.io</a>) and come to really love WordPress theming, I got a job offer from Tracy Levesque and Mia Levesque to work at their WordPress web agency, <a href="https://www.yikesinc.com/">Yikes Inc.</a></p>\n<h3>Finding My Place</h3>\n<p>Now, I’m a full-time WordPress developer and I couldn’t be more satisfied. Working at Yikes has sent my developer skills soaring over mountains and valleys. My curiosity is allowed to run wild and I’ve actually been diving into the plugin world, completely re-coding an internal plugin from the ground up and learning essential web programming practices in the process.</p>\n<p>My next goal in the WordPress community is to see more WordPress developers who look like me. And one step I’ve taken towards that goal is to co-teach a Intro to WordPress workshop at Codeland 2018 which I’m very excited (and nervous) for. And I’ll continue to be as visible and outspoken as possible to encourage diversity in this community.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Believe In Yourself" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Believe%20In%20Yourself&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbelieve-in-yourself%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Believe In Yourself" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbelieve-in-yourself%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbelieve-in-yourself%2F&title=Believe+In+Yourself" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Believe In Yourself"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/believe-in-yourself/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/012418-150x150.jpg&description=Believe In Yourself" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Believe In Yourself"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/believe-in-yourself/" title="Believe In Yourself"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/believe-in-yourself/">Believe In Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 13:00:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Ebonie Butler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: New Toolkit Simplifies the Process of Creating Gutenberg Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=77521";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"https://wptavern.com/new-toolkit-simplifies-the-process-of-creating-gutenberg-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5470:"<p><!-- wp:core/paragraph --></p>\n<p><a href="https://ahmadawais.com/">Ahmad Awais</a>, who <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-boilerplate-demonstrates-how-to-build-custom-blocks">created the Gutenberg Boilerplate</a> last year, has <a href="https://ahmadawais.com/create-guten-block-toolkit/">released</a> a <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block">Guten Block Toolkit</a>.

Yoast SEO breaks your sitemap up into chunks. On this site, the individual chunks were loading, but the sitemap index (its &#8220;table of contents&#8221;) would not load, and was giving a timeout error. This prevented search engines from finding the individual sitemap chunks.</p>\n<p>Sitemaps are really helpful for providing information to search engines about the content on your site, so fixing this issue was a high priority to the client! They were frustrated, and confused, because this was working just fine on their other sites.</p>\n<p>Given that this site has over a decade of content, I figured that Yoast SEO&#8217;s dynamic generation of the sitemap was simply taking too long, and the server was giving up.</p>\n<p>So I increased the site&#8217;s various timeout settings to 120 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>No good.</strong></p>\n<p>I increased the timeout settings to 300 seconds. Five whole minutes!</p>\n<p><strong>Still no good.</strong></p>\n<p>This illustrates one of the problems that WordPress sites can face when they accumulate a lot of content: <strong>dynamic processes start to take longer</strong>. A process that takes a reasonable 5 seconds with 5,000 posts might take 100 seconds with 500,000 posts. I could have eventually made the Yoast SEO sitemap index work if I increased the timeout high enough, but that wouldn&#8217;t have been a good solution.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It would have meant increasing the timeout settings irresponsibly high, leaving the server potentially open to abuse.</li>\n<li>Even though it is search engines, not people, who are requesting the sitemap, it is unreasonable to expect them to wait over 5 minutes for it to load. They&#8217;re likely to give up. They might even penalize the site in their rankings for being slow.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I needed the sitemap to be reliably generated without making the search engines wait.</p>\n<p><strong>When something intensive needs to happen reliably on a site, look to the command line.</strong></p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Yoast SEO doesn&#8217;t have <a href="http://wp-cli.org/">WP-CLI</a> (WordPress command line interface) commands, but that doesn&#8217;t matter — you can just use <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/eval/"><b>wp eval</b></a> to run arbitrary WordPress PHP code.</p>\n<p>After a little digging through the <a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/46802dbcf8e7d2ac0d6552f4de0923cd0eba2b07/inc/sitemaps/class-sitemaps.php#L345-L364">Yoast SEO code</a>, I determined that this WP-CLI command would output the index sitemap:</p>\n<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">wp eval \'\n$sm = new WPSEO_Sitemaps;\n$sm-&gt;build_root_map();\n$sm-&gt;output();\n\'</pre>\n<p>That took a good while to run on the command line, but that doesn&#8217;t matter, because I just set a <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto">cron job</a> to run it once a day and save its output to a static file.</p>\n<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">0 3 * * * cd /srv/www/example.com &amp;&amp; /usr/local/bin/wp eval \'$sm = new WPSEO_Sitemaps;$sm-&gt;build_root_map();$sm-&gt;output();\' &gt; /srv/www/example.com/wp-content/uploads/sitemap_index.xml</pre>\n<p>The final step that was needed was to modify a rewrite in the site&#8217;s Nginx config that would make the <b>/sitemap_index.xml</b> path point to the cron-created static file, instead of resolving to Yoast SEO&#8217;s dynamic generation URL.</p>\n<pre class="brush: plain; highlight: [4]; title: ; notranslate">location ~ ([^/]*)sitemap(.*).x(m|s)l$ {\n    rewrite ^/sitemap.xml$ /sitemap_index.xml permanent;\n    rewrite ^/([a-z]+)?-?sitemap.xsl$ /index.php?xsl=$1 last;\n    rewrite ^/sitemap_index.xml$ /wp-content/uploads/sitemap_index.xml last;\n    rewrite ^/([^/]+?)-sitemap([0-9]+)?.xml$ /index.php?sitemap=$1&amp;sitemap_n=$2 last;\n}</pre>\n<p>Now the sitemap index loads instantly (because it&#8217;s a static file), and is kept up-to-date with a reliable background process. The client is happy that they didn&#8217;t have to switch SEO plugins or install a separate sitemap plugin.

I&#x27;ve been processing the news for a few days and still don&#x27;t know where to begin. Dean was a writer, who wrote the software he wrote on. His websites were crafted, designed, and typeset so well you would have visited them even if they were filled with Lorem Ipsum, and paired with his writing you were drawn into an impossibly rich world. His blog was called Textism, and among many other things it introduced me to the art of typography.</p>\n\n<p>Later, he created Textpattern, without which WordPress wouldn&#x27;t exist. Later, he created Textdrive with Jason Hoffman, without which WordPress wouldn&#x27;t have found an early business model or had a home on the web. He brought a care and craft to everything he touched that inspires me to this day. As <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/01/dean_allen">John Gruber said</a>, "Dean strove for perfection and often achieved it." (Aside: Making typography better on the web led John Gruber to release Smarty Pants, Dean a tool called Textile, and myself something called Texturize all within a few months of each other; John continued his work and created Markdown, I put Texturize into WP, and Dean released Textile in Textpattern.)</p>\n\n<p>Years later, we became friends and shared many trips, walks, drinks, and meals together, often with Hanni and <a href="https://om.co/2018/01/18/dean-allen-rest-in-peace/">Om</a>. (When we overlapped in Vancouver he immediately texted "I&#x27;ll show you some butt-kicking food and drink.") His zest for life was matched with an encyclopedic knowledge of culture and voracious reading (and later podcast listening) habits. I learned so much in our time together, a web inspiration who turned for me into a real-life mensch. He was endlessly generous with his time and counsel in design, prose, and fashion. I learned the impossibly clever sentences he wrote, that you assumed were the product of a small writing crew or at least a few revisions, came annoyingly easily to him, an extension of how he actually thought and wrote and the culmination of a lifetime of telling stories and connecting to the human psyche.</p>\n\n<p>Dean, who (of course) was also a great photographer, didn&#x27;t love having his own photo taken but would occasionally tolerate me when I pointed a camera at him <a href="https://om.co/2018/01/18/dean-allen-rest-in-peace/">and Om has a number of the photos on his post</a>. There&#x27;s one that haunts me: before getting BBQ we were at his friend&#x27;s apartment in Vancouver, listening to Mingus and enjoying hand-crafted old fashioneds with <a href="https://ma.tt/files/2018/01/IMG_7147.jpg">antique bitters</a>, and despite the rain we went on the roof to see the art that was visible from there. He obliged to a photo this time though and we took photos of each other individually in front of a sign that said "EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT." It wasn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s what I imagine Dean would say right now if he could.</p>\n\n<div class="wp-block-gallery alignnone columns-2 is-cropped">\n    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2018/01/IMG_7151.jpg?w=604&ssl=1" />\n    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2018/01/IMG_7158.jpg?w=604&ssl=1" />\n</div>\n\n<img src="https://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2018/01/104050690_ce98a95092_o.jpg?w=604&ssl=1" />\n    When we first met, in 2006, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/textdriveinc/104050690/in/photostream/">from Jason</a>.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 05:21:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 301 – WordPress in HigherEd, Accessibility, and More With Rachel Cherry";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=77497&preview=true&preview_id=77497";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-301-wordpress-in-highered-accessibility-and-more-with-rachel-cherry";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2840:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://bamadesigner.com/">Rachel Cherry</a>, Senior Software Engineer for <a href="http://www.disneyinteractive.com/">Disney Interactive</a> and Director of <a href="https://wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a>.

This has worked very well in many communities, with over 120 WordCamps being hosted around the world in 2017.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes though, passionate and enthusiastic community members can’t pull together enough people in their community to make a WordCamp happen. To address this, we introduced <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/">the WordCamp Incubator program</a> in 2016.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The goal of the incubator program is <strong>to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event.</strong> In 2016, members of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/">the global community team</a> worked with volunteers in three cities — Denpasar, Harare and Medellín — giving direct, hands-on assistance in making local WordCamps possible. All three of these WordCamp incubators <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/">were a great success</a>, so we&#x27;re bringing the incubator program back for 2018.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Where should the next WordCamp incubators be? If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven’t been able to get a community started, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next few weeks, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the chosen cities by the end of March.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>To apply, </strong><a href="https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application"><strong>fill in the application</strong></a><strong> by March 15, 2018.</strong> You don’t need to have any specific information handy, it’s just a form to let us know you’re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don’t want to be the main organizer, but for this to work well we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.<br /></p>\n\n<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to hearing from you!<br /></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"5577";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:36:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.9.4 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/02/wordpress-4-9-4-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 06 Feb 2018 16:17:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.9";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5559";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:350:"WordPress 4.9.4 is now available.

This does not necessarily make these guidelines complete, but rather more user-friendly and practical; they govern how developers build plugins for the Plugin Directory, so they need to evolve with the global community that the Directory serves.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to contribute to these guidelines, you can make a pull request to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-plugin-guidelines">the GitHub repository</a> or email <a href="mailto:plugins@wordpress.org">plugins@wordpress.org</a>.

Particularly of note were:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Issues relating to the caching of theme template files.</li>\n    <li>A MediaElement JavaScript error preventing users of certain languages from being able to upload media files.</li>\n    <li>The inability to edit theme and plugin files on Windows based servers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/11/28/wordpress-4-9-1-scheduled-for-november-29th/">This post has more information about all of the issues fixed in 4.9.1 if you&#x27;d like to learn more</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">Download WordPress 4.9.1</a> or venture over to Dashboard → Updates and click &quot;Update Now.&quot; Sites that support automatic background updates are already beginning to update automatically.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 4.9.1:</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/schlessera/">Alain Schlesser</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/afercia/">Andrea Fercia</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/la-geek/">Angelika Reisiger</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/blobfolio/">Blobfolio</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/bobbingwide/">bobbingwide</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/chetan200891/">Chetan Prajapati</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dd32/">Dion Hulse</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ocean90/">Dominik Schilling (ocean90)</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/edo888/">edo888</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/erich_k4wp/">Erich Munz</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/flixos90/">Felix Arntz</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/mista-flo/">Florian TIAR</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/pento/">Gary Pendergast</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ibenic/">Igor Benic</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jfarthing84/">Jeff Farthing</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17/">Jeffrey Paul</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jeremyescott/">jeremyescott</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/joemcgill/">Joe McGill</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion/">John Blackbourn</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnpgreen/">johnpgreen</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ryelle/">Kelly Dwan</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/lenasterg/">lenasterg</a>, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/clorith/">Marius L.

New features in 4.9 will smooth your design workflow and keep you safe from coding errors.</p>\n\n<p>Featuring design drafts, scheduling, and locking, along with preview links, the Customizer workflow improves collaboration for content creators. What’s more, code syntax highlighting and error checking will make for a clean and smooth site building experience. Finally, if all that wasn’t pretty great, we’ve got an awesome new Gallery widget and improvements to theme browsing and switching.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2 style="text-align:center">Customizer Workflow Improved </h2>\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/customizer-workflow-improved-small.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n<h3>Draft and Schedule Site Design Customizations</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, you read that right. Just like you can draft and revise posts and schedule them to go live on the date and time you choose, you can now tinker with your site’s design and schedule those design changes to go live as you please.</p>\n\n<h3>Collaborate with Design Preview Links</h3>\n\n<p>Need to get some feedback on proposed site design changes? WordPress 4.9 gives you a preview link you can send to colleagues and customers so that you can collect and integrate feedback before you schedule the changes to go live. Can we say collaboration++?</p>\n\n<h3>Design Locking Guards Your Changes</h3>\n\n<p>Ever encounter a scenario where two designers walk into a project and designer A overrides designer B’s beautiful changes? WordPress 4.9’s design lock feature (similar to post locking) secures your draft design so that no one can make changes to it or erase all your hard work.</p>\n\n<h3>A Prompt to Protect Your Work</h3>\n\n<p>Were you lured away from your desk before you saved your new draft design? Fear not, when you return, WordPress 4.9 will politely ask whether or not you’d like to save your unsaved changes.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2 style="text-align:center">Coding Enhancements</h2>\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/coding-enhancements-small.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n<h3>Syntax Highlighting and Error Checking? Yes, Please!</h3>\n\n<p>You’ve got a display problem but can’t quite figure out exactly what went wrong in the CSS you lovingly wrote. With syntax highlighting and error checking for CSS editing and the Custom HTML widget introduced in WordPress 4.8.1, you’ll pinpoint coding errors quickly. Practically guaranteed to help you scan code more easily, and suss out &amp; fix code errors quickly.</p>\n\n<h3>Sandbox for Safety</h3>\n\n<p>The dreaded white screen. You’ll avoid it when working on themes and plugin code because WordPress 4.9 will warn you about saving an error. You’ll sleep better at night.</p>\n\n<h3>Warning: Potential Danger Ahead!</h3>\n\n<p>When you edit themes and plugins directly, WordPress 4.9 will politely warn you that this is a dangerous practice and will recommend that you draft and test changes before updating your file. Take the safe route: You’ll thank you. Your team and customers will thank you.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2 style="text-align:center">Even More Widget Updates </h2>\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/even-more-widget-updates-small.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n<h3>The New Gallery Widget</h3>\n\n<p>An incremental improvement to the media changes hatched in WordPress 4.8, you can now add a gallery via this new widget. Yes!</p>\n\n<h3>Press a Button, Add Media</h3>\n\n<p>Want to add media to your text widget? Embed images, video, and audio directly into the widget along with your text, with our simple but useful Add Media button. Woo!</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2 style="text-align:center">Site Building Improvements </h2>\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/site-building-improvements-small.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n<h3>More Reliable Theme Switching</h3>\n\n<p>When you switch themes, widgets sometimes think they can just move location. Improvements in WordPress 4.9 offer more persistent menu and widget placement when you decide it’s time for a new theme. </p>\n\n<h3>Find and Preview the Perfect Theme</h3>\n\n<p>Looking for a new theme for your site? Now, from within the Customizer, you can search, browse, and preview over 2600 themes before deploying changes to your site. What’s more, you can speed your search with filters for subject, features, and layout.</p>\n\n<h3>Better Menu Instructions = Less Confusion</h3>\n\n<p>Were you confused by the steps to create a new menu? Perhaps no longer! We’ve ironed out the UX for a smoother menu creation process. Newly updated copy will guide you.</p>\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n<h2 style="text-align:center">Lend a Hand with Gutenberg 🤝</h2>\n\n<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/gutenberg-1.png?w=632&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>\n\n<p>WordPress is working on a new way to create and control your content and we’d love to have your help.

At the time I was just a man with an ideea but 2 weeks later I was a man with a plan. We jumped on this adventure and learned a lot along the way. Two days after launching we had our first client. In what we do, being creative is crucial. And we love the moments when we have to make our brain work and produce new, crazy, beautiful ideas.</p>		\n			<a href="#portfolioModal1">\n						Find More\n					</a>\n			<h1>once upon a time</h1>		\n		<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice; `only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.’</p><p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!’ they cried out when they saw Alice coming. `There’s plenty of room!’ said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p><p>`At any rate I’ll never go there again!’ said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. `It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!’ Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. `That’s very curious!’ she thought.</p><p>`But everything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.’ And in she went.</p><p>Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. `Now, I’ll manage better this time,’ she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and then–she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> Years on the market: 3<br /> Team members: 12<br /> Happy clients: 47		\n			<h1>meet the magicians</h1>		\n		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
